README:
  As this particular project is very rudimentary, this file will be short. 

The programs included will do the following calculations given a data set:
1. find the average
2. find the median
3. find the mode
4. find the largest data value
5. find the smallest data value
6. find the variance
7. find the standard deviation

More potential analyses may be included at a later data.
